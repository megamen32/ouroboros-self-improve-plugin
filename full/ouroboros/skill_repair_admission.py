"""X3 (owner 11=B): hash-bound skill repair — CAS on every payload write.

A repair is admitted AGAINST one exact payload state: ``base_content_hash``,
captured immutably at admission (the promoted managed-task seam canonicalizes
every skill_repair constraint, so both the marketplace auto-repair prompt and a
manual repair pass through it). Every payload write by the ADMITTED repair task
then CAS-checks the payload against the last state this repair itself produced
(``expected_content_hash``, advanced after each own write). A hash the repair
did not produce means a CONCURRENT actor changed the payload mid-repair: the
repair is STALE and must terminalize, typed.

No restore is promised — ``last_known_good`` carries version/sha/ts only, never
payload bytes, so there is nothing to restore FROM; the honest fix is a fresh
repair admitted against the new state. No staged machinery (owner 11=B).

Foreign writers (the owner's own light-mode edit lane, another task) are NOT
blocked here — the repair verifies ITS OWN chain, and a foreign write surfaces
as drift on the repair's next CAS instead of gating everyone else's authority
(AGENTS.md proportionality).
