"""Containment verification for ONE delegated run (extracted from tools/delegate.py
for the module-size gate — same logic, same names, no behavioural change).

The nanny asks the ENGINE's own artifacts what a delegated run actually ran under
— the applied access profile and the applied scoped HOME — and compares them with
what the host's authority entitled the child to. A recorded WIDER profile or an
unexcused operator-home landing is a containment breach the nanny cancels on; an
absent fact stays absence ("unproven"), reported by the evidence reader instead of
enforced as a fault.

    """Did the scoped harness HOME the host ASKED for actually get APPLIED?

    Asking is not evidence: ``execution.delegated`` is a request, and a request that
    the engine accepted and then did not honour leaves the harness holding the
    operator's real ``$HOME`` — with ``~/.claudexor/v3/daemon/token`` in it, which
    grants the entire ``/v2`` control API. Claudexor records the APPLIED fact on each
    attempt (``harness_home_isolated`` / ``harness_home_dir``) and projects it onto no
    ``/v2`` response, so the artifact is the only witness there is.

    THE RULE IS TWO EXACT FACTS (phase A3, Poltergeist sprint — the simplified
    form): a breach is ONLY a recorded ``harness_home_isolated: false``, or an
    applied home EQUAL to the operator's own (the claim is the lie, whatever
    boundary sits beside it). Everything else is reported, not enforced:

    - A MISSING fact stays absence. Current Claudexor spreads the applied facts
      into ``attemptFailureRecord`` too, but ``harness_home_isolated`` is the one
      optional member, omitted when the attempt died before its home was decided
      — "a01 errored, a02 repaired it" is the ordinary converge loop, and reading
      absence as a fault cancelled healthy finished runs. Unproven is REPORTED by
      ``_containment_evidence``, never enforced.
    - A scoped home NESTED under ``$HOME`` — with or without a recorded OS
      boundary — is NOT a breach. The engine roots every scoped home under its
      runtime dir, which lives under ``$HOME`` on every host it supports, and on
      hosts with no boundary mechanism (every non-macOS host today) it CANNOT
      record one, so the old nested-without-mechanism rule cancelled every
      mutating Linux run post-factum (the colleague's issue-2 class). The nested
      shape flows to the EXISTING disclosed-unconfined path instead
      (``delegate_run_unconfined`` + the three-place disclosure): the child
      already holds a shell in this worktree, and the marginal step from "shell"
      to "``~``-relative token reachability" does not justify cutting the lane on
      every boundary-less host (AGENTS.md "Disclose instead of forbid";
      Proportionality). ``confinement_unavailable_reason`` from the same attempt
      artifact amplifies that disclosure — telemetry, never an admission token.
