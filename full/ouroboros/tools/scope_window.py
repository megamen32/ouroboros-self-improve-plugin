"""Scope-reviewer WINDOW authority: evidence-typed resolution + honest wording (RS5).

Extracted from ``tools/scope_review.py`` for the module-size gate at synthesis —
the p1 atlas, p5x session-delivery and p7a window-evidence unions each fit alone
and overflowed together. ``scope_review`` re-imports every name under its old
private alias, so its tests and callers keep exactly one patch point.

    Replaces the deleted static per-model window table: a confirmed/asserted probe
    (provider metadata or owner-ack) for the reviewer's REAL active route gives the
    real window, and only such SOURCED, non-stale, >=1M evidence carries blocking
    authority (BIBLE P3 — "a reviewer whose window cannot be established by sourced
    Capability Evidence is treated as too small rather than assumed adequate").

    With NO evidence the result still carries a SIZING number so the review is
    dispatched rather than declined before it starts — the 1M figure for the shipped
    designated reviewer, a conservative sub-floor for anything else, matching what
    each can plausibly hold. Neither carries a KNOWN status, so neither can authorise:
    the sentinel sizes a prompt, it does not sign a verdict. That split is why this
    returns the whole record instead of a bare int — a number alone cannot say where
    it came from, and the caller that needs to know then guesses.

    Every route gets one lazy metadata-only fetch per evidence-TTL period (never
    generative, never a paid call), concurrent resolutions of the same route
    serialized by the per-route lock; inside the TTL the cache answers and the path
    stays hot-path safe. How often the network is re-asked is owned by
    ``capability_evidence.probe``'s record TTL, deliberately NOT by the process
    lifetime (v6.87.45: a per-process memo outlived the 24h record and wedged
