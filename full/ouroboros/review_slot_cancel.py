"""The hosted-review slot poller's cancel-honesty helpers.

Extracted from ``ouroboros/review_execution.py`` at the module-size gate — the
same split as ``delegate_interactions`` out of ``tools/delegate.py``, and one
coherent concern: when the slot poller must stop a delegated review run (parked
question or slot timeout), what did the cancel actually PROVE, and how is that
worded honestly? ``review_execution`` imports these names and remains the only
caller; the poll loop itself stays there.
